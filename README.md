[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/REPLACE_WITH_BADGE_ID/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/REPLACE_WITH_SITE_NAME/deploys)

## Netlify Deploy

- Build command: `bash netlify-build.sh`
- Publish directory: `build/web`
- Config: `netlify.toml` pins Flutter `stable` `3.35.0` and sets WASM headers.
- Deploys: https://app.netlify.com/teams/eltechnunana/projects

## Local Preview

- Serve the built web assets locally on port `3002`:

```
flutter build web --release
flutter pub global run dhttpd --host localhost --port 3002 --path build/web
```

- Open: `http://localhost:3002/`

## Android CI Build (Signed AAB)

Use the included GitHub Actions workflow to build a signed Android App Bundle without setting up the local Android SDK.

### Prerequisites
- Ensure your keystore exists locally at `android/app/release-key.jks` and you know:
  - Keystore password
  - Key alias
  - Key password
- Confirm `android/app/build.gradle.kts` is configured for release signing (already wired to use `android/key.properties`).

### Add GitHub Secrets
Add these repository secrets in GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:
- `RELEASE_KEYSTORE_BASE64` – Base64 of `android/app/release-key.jks`
- `RELEASE_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` – Keystore password
- `RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS` – Key alias
- `RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD` – Key password

To generate the Base64 value on Windows PowerShell (run at repo root):

```
Set-Location bajetimor_sqlite
$path = "android/app/release-key.jks"
[Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes($path)) | Set-Content -NoNewline -Encoding ascii "release-key.jks.base64"
Get-Content "release-key.jks.base64" | Clip
```

This writes the Base64 to `release-key.jks.base64` and copies it to your clipboard; paste into the `RELEASE_KEYSTORE_BASE64` secret.

### Trigger the Workflow
- Go to GitHub → Actions → "Build Android AAB" → Run workflow.
- The workflow installs Android SDK packages, reconstructs the keystore and `key.properties` from secrets, and builds the signed AAB.
- Download artifact from the workflow run: `bajetimor-signed-aab` → `app-release.aab`.

### Notes
- CI removes `android/local.properties` to use the runner’s SDK.
- If the workflow fails on dependencies, run `flutter pub outdated` locally and adjust constraints in `pubspec.yaml` before re-running.
